![Portfolio website](readme-files/amIresponsive.png)


my goal for this project is to create a full-stack site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask and MongoDB to create a website that cook enthusiasts can use to share and collect recipes from each other. users will be able to register and create an account where they are look for recipes or even add some of their own using CRUD functionality.
