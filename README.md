## USER EXPERIENCE

The structure of the site was designed to be simple and easy to use. It has a good balance of images and content, so it does not overload the user,
while giving them enough information to create recipes. The step by step structure ensures the user knows what the next steps are and doesn't leave
the user needing more knowledge.

* The website is for the following user types:
  * Users with no previous experience about cooking, or experience on how to cook food, and would like to start learning.
  * Users with basic experience about cooking who wish to hone their cooking skills while practising making new recipes.
  * Users with advanced experience in cooking, who are feeling adventurous and looking for some new recipes.
  * Users who are highly skilled and are looking to add their own twist on recipes that already exist.
